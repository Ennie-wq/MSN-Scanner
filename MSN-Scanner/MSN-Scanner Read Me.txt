Motivation: Why I Built This

In Nigeria’s rapidly evolving technology ecosystem, many organizations — especially **SMEs, fintechs, and educational institutions** — face growing cybersecurity threats but **lack affordable, accessible vulnerability assessment tools**.  
Most commercial scanners are expensive, require advanced infrastructure, or demand specialized training that many small IT teams can’t easily access.

I created MSN-Scanner to bridge this gap by providing a simple, open-source vulnerability scanning solution that:
- Helps organizations identify basic security weaknesses early
- Encourages local cybersecurity awareness and skill development
- Supports students and professionals in learning how scanners operate internally

My goal is to empower the next generation of Nigerian and African cybersecurity engineers with practical, cost-effective tools built locally for local challenges.
